    <h3>Why am I taking this course?</h3>
    <p>I worked this summer with Precisely, a data management company. I
        did lots of front-end work and want to take this course to learn how to design
        web pages with the tools (HTML, CSS, Typescript) that I learned over the summer.
        My job when I graduate will most likely revolve around front-end software engineering.
    </p>
    <h3>What experience do I have creating content for the web?</h3>
    <p>Like I said above, I spent the summer building UI components such as buttons, menus, etc.
        These were taken from PrimeNG, an open source library, and brought into Precisely's PrismNG
        where proper theming was applied. After the internship, I started Udemy's WebDev Bootcamp 2022
        online class and began working on my personal website.
    </p>
    <h3>What are my goals this semester?</h3>
    <p>I want to really improve my proficiency with Javascript, as that is the part of front-end development
        that I have the least experience with. Additionally, learning how to create designs in Figma and
        the whole design process overall will help me become a better developer.

    <h3>Learn computing summaries</h3>
    <h4>File Organization</h4>
    <p>Files on computer are stored in a series of folders or directories. The location of files within your computer
        is called the <b>path</b>. As we work with files, it is important to have a naming convention.
        Three guidelines to follow are:
    <ol>
        <li>Avoid abbrieviations</li>
        <li>Append version numbers and dates</li>
        <li>Use descriptive names</li>
    </ol>
    There are also established conventions, such as PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case, and so on.
    It is a good idea to name files iteratively as well. This means using v1, v2, v3 as you make changes
    instead of relative terms such as "final draft" or "completed". Often times we end up changing these
    files anyways.
    </p>
    <h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
    <p>As you start working with web dev, it is important to develop an efficient work flow. Keyboard
        shortcuts offer a quick way to do tasks that often take multiple clicks. A basic example is
        CTRL+C on windows to copy highlighted text. This usually takes two additional clicks, a right clicks
        to bring up the option menu and then selecting the 'copy' option. Combining shortcuts into a routine
        can make frequent tasks turn into muscle memory. For example, you web-dev edit-save-refresh loop
        can be done entirely on the keyboard to a faster effect. Keyboard shortcuts are easy to look up
        if you forget them, but you should memorize all of the shortcuts you use regularly so that they can
        actually save you time during your work.

    <h3>My favorite web projects</h3>
    <h4>
        <a href="https://direkris.itch.io/you-are-jeff-bezos">You are Jeff Bezos</a>
    </h4>
    <p>I loved the clear satire and humor playing this game for even two minutes. The ability to save
        your game or upload a past one from your files is very impressive and a skill I would love to learn.
    </p>
    <h4>
        <a href="https://stars.chromeexperiments.com/">100000 Stars</a>
    </h4>
    <p>This site is so fascinating visually. I thought the tour at the beginning was really cool, I guess
        they used animations to navigate through the website tour. A projet that is this beautiful would be
        amazing to call your own.
    </p>
    <h4><a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/10/magazine/jd-beck-domi.html?action=click&module=Editors%20Picks&pgtype=Homepage">Who
            are these kids?
        </a>
    </h4>
    <p>I love the color scheme on this website, it is very unique but still pleasing. I like the blocky
        animations, they have taken basic blocking design and made it cool. Bonus points since JD Beck and DOMi are
        sick.

            I took my girl to go bowling downtown at the Red Door
            After an argument I started because I thought she didn't like me anymore
            I can't help it, sometimes I feel pitiful
            And of course, she's so young and beautiful
            I bought us two glasses of Coke
            That's her favorite and I wanted to make up for earlier
            But I dropped her glass and it broke
            So I just gave my glass to her
            She laughed and so did I, in our lane
            Then she went to the vending machine to buy a candy cane
            But right next to that was a boy I knew with a spring in his hand
            Playing a country pinball machine called "Stand by Your Man"
            I saw him talk to her but I stayed in my lane
            And played my game, steady
            And was thinking of the day when I'd be too old to throw a ball this heavy
            But I guess I'm young now, so it's easy to knock 'em all down
            Then I looked and saw her say to him, "You're really hittin' that ball around"
            And he's looking at her the way I did when I first met her
            I could see in his face white flowers, and cups of coffee, and love letters
            I was sorry to interrupt that game
            But I went and did it anyway
            I dropped my red bowling ball through the glass of the machine
            And said, "Are you quick enough to hit this ball, Mr. Clean?"
            I was scared to lose her, so I couldn't help being mean
            And that ended both of our games
            I said I was sorry but my girl left with him just the same
            I thought how much I hate when love makes me act this way
            I was bent over a broken pinball machine in a bowling alley
            And I threw it all away
            Well, isn't it all just a big game?</pre>
