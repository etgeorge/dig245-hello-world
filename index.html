        <h2>Senior, computer science major</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why am I taking this course?</h3>
        <p>I worked this summer with Precisely, a data management company. I
            did lots of front-end work and want to take this course to learn how to design
            web pages with the tools (HTML, CSS, Typescript) that I learned over the summer.
            My job when I graduate will most likely revolve around front-end software engineering.
        </p>
        <h3>What experience do I have creating content for the web?</h3>
        <p>Like I said above, I spent the summer building UI components such as buttons, menus, etc.
            These were taken from PrimeNG, an open source library, and brought into Precisely's PrismNG
            where proper theming was applied. After the internship, I started Udemy's WebDev Bootcamp 2022
            online class and began working on my personal website.
        </p>
        <h3>What are my goals this semester?</h3>
        <p>I want to really improve my proficiency with Javascript, as that is the part of front-end development
            that I have the least experience with. Additionally, learning how to create designs in Figma and 
            the whole design process overall will help me become a better developer.

        <h4>File Organization</h3>
        <p>Files on computer are stored in a series of folders or directories. The location of files within your computer
            is called the <b>path</b>. As we work with files, it is important to have a naming convention. 
            Three guidelines to follow are:
            <ol>
                <li>Avoid abbrieviations</li>
                <li>Append version numbers and dates</li>
                <li>Use descriptive names</li>
            </ol> 
            There are also established conventions, such as PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case, and so on. 
            It is a good idea to name files iteratively as well. This means using v1, v2, v3 as you make changes
            instead of relative terms such as "final draft" or "completed". Often times we end up changing these 
            files anyways.
        </p>
        <h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
        <p>As you start working with web dev, it is important to develop an efficient work flow. Keyboard
            shortcuts offer a quick way to do tasks that often take multiple clicks. A basic example is
            CTRL+C on windows to copy highlighted text. This usually takes two additional clicks, a right clicks
            to bring up the option menu and then selecting the 'copy' option. Combining shortcuts into a routine
            can make frequent tasks turn into muscle memory. For example, you web-dev edit-save-refresh loop
            can be done entirely on the keyboard to a faster effect. Keyboard shortcuts are easy to look up 
            if you forget them, but you should memorize all of the shortcuts you use regularly so that they can 
            actually save you time during your work.
